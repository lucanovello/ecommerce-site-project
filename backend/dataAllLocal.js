He became known by his nickname Verrocchio, from vero occhio, which in Italian means "true eye", a tribute given to him for his artistic achievement.  Few paintings are attributed to him with certainty, but a number of important painters were trained at his workshop.  His pupils included Leonardo da Vinci, Pietro Perugino and Lorenzo di Credi.  His greatest importance was as a sculptor and his last work, the Equestrian statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni in Venice, is generally accepted as a masterpiece.',

He is most famous for his portraits of Charles I of England and his family and court, painted with a relaxed elegance that was to be the dominant influence on English portrait-painting for the next 150 years.  He also painted biblical and mythological subjects, displayed outstanding facility as a draughtsman, and was an important innovator in water colour and etching.  The Van Dyke beard is named after him.',

His importance resides in his contributions to both Impressionism and Post-Impressionism.  Pissarro studied from great forerunners, including Gustave Courbet and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot.

        'Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (September 28, 1571 - July 18, 1610) was an Italian painter active in Rome, Naples, Malta, and Sicily from the early 1590s to 1610.  His paintings combine a realistic observation of the human state, both physical and emotional, with a dramatic use of lighting, and they had a formative influence on Baroque painting.  Caravaggio employed close physical observation with a dramatic use of chiaroscuro that came to be known as tenebrism.  He made the technique a dominant stylistic element, darkening shadows and transfixing subjects in bright shafts of light.  Caravaggio vividly expressed crucial moments and scenes, often featuring violent struggles, torture and death.  He worked rapidly, with live models, preferring to forego drawings and work directly onto the canvas.  His influence on the new Baroque style that emerged from Mannerism was profound.',

        "Charles Burton Barber (1845 - 1894), was an English painter who attained great success with his paintings of children and their pets.  Barber was born in Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, and studied from the age of 18 at the Royal Academy, London - receiving a silver medal for drawing in 1864, and first exhibiting there in 1866.  During his lifetime Barber was regarded as one of Britain's finest animal painters and received commissions from Queen Victoria to do paintings of her with grandchildren and dogs, and also the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) and his pets.  A number of his portraits are in the Royal Collection.",

The prolific firm produced prints from paintings by fine artists as black and white lithographs that were hand colored.  Lithographic prints could be reproduced quickly and purchased inexpensively, and the firm called itself "the Grand Central Depot for Cheap and Popular Prints" and advertised its lithographs as "colored engravings for the people".',

        'Edgar Degas (July 19, 1834 - September 27, 1917) was a French artist famous for his paintings, sculptures, prints, and drawings.  He is especially identified with the subject of dance; more than half of his works depict dancers.  He is regarded as one of the founders of Impressionism, although he rejected the term, preferring to be called a realist.  He was a superb draftsman, and particularly masterly in depicting movement, as can be seen in his rendition of dancers, racecourse subjects and female nudes.  His portraits are notable for their psychological complexity and for their portrayal of human isolation.  At the beginning of his career, Degas wanted to be a history painter, a calling for which he was well prepared by his rigorous academic training and close study of classic art.  In his early thirties, he changed course, and by bringing the traditional methods of a history painter to bear on contemporary subject matter, he became a classical painter of modern life.',

        "Edouard Manet (January 23, 1832 - April 30, 1883) was a French painter.  He was one of the first 19th-century artists to paint modern life, and a pivotal figure in the transition from Realism to Impressionism.  Born into an upper-class household with strong political connections, Manet rejected the future originally envisioned for him, and became engrossed in the world of painting.  His early masterworks, The Luncheon on the Grass (Le dejeuner sur l'herbe) and Olympia, both 1863, caused great controversy and served as rallying points for the young painters who would create Impressionism.  Today, these are considered watershed paintings that mark the start of modern art.  The last 20 years of Manet's life saw him form bonds with other great artists of the time, and develop his own style that would be heralded as innovative and serve as a major influence for future painters.",

        "Ferdinand Victor Eugene Delacroix (April 26, 1798 - August 13, 1863) was a French Romantic artist regarded from the outset of his career as the leader of the French Romantic school.  As a painter and muralist, Delacroix's use of expressive brushstrokes and his study of the optical effects of colour profoundly shaped the work of the Impressionists, while his passion for the exotic inspired the artists of the Symbolist movement.  A fine lithographer, Delacroix illustrated various works of William Shakespeare, the Scottish author Walter Scott and the German author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.  In contrast to the Neoclassical perfectionism of his chief rival Ingres, Delacroix took for his inspiration the art of Rubens and painters of the Venetian Renaissance, with an attendant emphasis on colour and movement rather than clarity of outline and carefully modelled form.",

        'Francisco Jose de Goya y Lucientes (March 30, 1746 - April 16, 1828) was a Spanish romantic painter and printmaker.  He is considered the most important Spanish artist of late 18th and early 19th centuries and throughout his long career was a commentator and chronicler of his era.  Immensely successful in his lifetime, Goya is often referred to as both the last of the Old Masters and the first of the moderns.  He was born to a modest family in 1746 in the village of Fuendetodos in Aragon.  He studied painting from age 14 under Jose Luzan y Martinez and moved to Madrid to study with Anton Raphael Mengs.  He became a court painter to the Spanish Crown in 1786 and this early portion of his career is marked by portraits of the Spanish aristocracy and royalty, and Rococo style tapestry cartoons designed for the royal palace.',

Seurat's artistic personality was compounded of qualities which are usually supposed to be opposed and incompatible: on the one hand, his extreme and delicate sensibility; on the other, a passion for logical abstraction and an almost mathematical precision of mind. His large-scale work, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte (1884 - 1886), altered the direction of modern art by initiating Neo-impressionism, and is one of the icons of late 19th-century painting.",

        'Gustav Klimt (July 14, 1862 - February 6, 1918) was an Austrian symbolist painter and one of the most prominent members of the Vienna Secession movement.  Klimt is noted for his paintings, murals, sketches, and other objets d\'art.  His primary subject was the female body, and his works are marked by a frank eroticism.  In addition to his figurative works, which include allegories and portraits, he painted landscapes.  Among the artists of the Vienna Secession, Klimt was the most influenced by Japanese art and its methods.  As he developed a more personal style, his work was the subject of controversy being criticized as pornographic.  He subsequently accepted no more public commissions, but achieved a new success with the paintings of his "golden phase", many of which include gold leaf.',

        'Gustav Klimt (July 14, 1862 - February 6, 1918) was an Austrian symbolist painter and one of the most prominent members of the Vienna Secession movement.  Klimt is noted for his paintings, murals, sketches, and other objets d\'art.  His primary subject was the female body, and his works are marked by a frank eroticism.  In addition to his figurative works, which include allegories and portraits, he painted landscapes.  Among the artists of the Vienna Secession, Klimt was the most influenced by Japanese art and its methods.  As he developed a more personal style, his work was the subject of controversy being criticized as pornographic.  He subsequently accepted no more public commissions, but achieved a new success with the paintings of his "golden phase", many of which include gold leaf.',

        'Henri Marie Raymond de Toulouse-Lautrec-Monfa (November 24, 1864 - September 9, 1901), also known as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, was a French painter, printmaker, draughtsman, caricaturist and illustrator whose immersion in the colourful and theatrical life of Paris in the late 19th century allowed him to produce a collection of enticing, elegant and provocative images of the modern, sometimes decadent, affairs of those times.  Toulouse-Lautrec is among the best-known painters of the Post-Impressionist period, with Cezanne, Van Gogh and Gauguin.',

        "Henry Ossawa Tanner (June 21, 1859 - May 25, 1937) was an American artist.  Tanner moved to Paris, France, in 1891 to study, and continued to live there after being accepted in French artistic circles.  His painting entitled Daniel in the Lions' Den was accepted into the 1896 Salon, the official art exhibition of the Academie des Beaux-Arts in Paris.  After his own self-study in art as a young man, Tanner enrolled in 1879 at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia.  He became a favorite of the painter Thomas Eakins, who had recently begun teaching there.  Tanner made other connections among artists, including Robert Henri.  In the late 1890s he was sponsored for a trip to Palestine by Rodman Wanamaker, who was impressed by his paintings of biblical themes.",

        "Ion Theodorescu-Sion (January 2, 1882 - March 31, 1939) was a Romanian painter and draftsman, known for his contributions to modern art and especially for his traditionalist, primitivist, handicraft-inspired and Christian painting. Trained in academic art, initially an Impressionist, he dabbled in various modern styles in the years before World War I.  Theodorescu-Sion's palette was interchangeably post-Impressionist, Divisionist, Realist, Symbolist, Synthetist, FauveorCubist, but his creation had one major ideological focus: depicting peasant life in its natural setting.  In time, Sion contributed to the generational goal of creating a specifically Romanian modern art, located at the intersection of folk tradition, primitivist tendencies borrowed from the West, and 20th-century agrarian politics.",

        'John Singer Sargent (January 12, 1856 - April 14, 1925) was an American artist, considered the "leading portrait painter of his generation" for his evocations of Edwardian era luxury.  During his career, he created roughly 900 oil paintings and more than 2,000 watercolors, as well as countless sketches and charcoal drawings.  His oeuvre documents worldwide travel, from Venice to the Tyrol, Corfu, the Middle East, Montana, Maine, and Florida.  His parents were American, but he was trained in Paris prior to moving to London.  Sargent enjoyed international acclaim as a portrait painter, although not without controversy and some critical reservation; an early submission to the Paris Salon, his Portrait of Madame X, was intended to consolidate his position as a society painter, but it resulted in scandal instead.  In later life Sargent expressed ambivalence about the restrictions of formal portrait work, and devoted much of his energy to mural painting and working en plein air.',

During his career, he created roughly 900 oil paintings and more than 2,000 watercolors, as well as countless sketches and charcoal drawings.  His oeuvre documents worldwide travel, from Venice to the Tyrol, Corfu, the Middle East, Montana, Maine, and Florida.  His parents were American, but he was trained in Paris prior to moving to London.  Sargent enjoyed international acclaim as a portrait painter, although not without controversy and some critical reservation; an early submission to the Paris Salon, his Portrait of Madame X, was intended to consolidate his position as a society painter, but it resulted in scandal instead.  In later life Sargent expressed ambivalence about the restrictions of formal portrait work, and devoted much of his energy to mural painting and working en plein air.',

Born in Rome, Italy, to English parents who were both painters, he later moved to London, where he enrolled in the Royal Academy of Art.  He soon began exhibiting at their annual summer exhibitions, focusing on the creation of large canvas works depicting scenes from the daily life and mythology of ancient Greece.

        'Katsushika Hokusai (c. October 31, 1760 - May 10, 1849) was a Japanese artist, ukiyo-e painter and printmaker of the Edo period.  He was influenced by Sesshu Toyo and other styles of Chinese painting.  Born in Edo (now Tokyo), Hokusai is best known as author of the woodblock print series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji ( Fugaku Sanjuroku-kei, c.  1831) which includes the internationally iconic print, The Great Wave off Kanagawa.  Hokusai created the "Thirty-Six Views" both as a response to a domestic travel boom and as part of a personal obsession with Mount Fuji.  It was this series, specifically The Great Wave print and Fine Wind, Clear Morning, that secured Hokusais fame both in Japan and overseas.  As historian Richard Lane concludes, "Indeed, if there is one work that made Hokusai\'s name, both in Japan and abroad, it must be this monumental print-series".  While Hokusai\'s work prior to this series is certainly important, it was not until this series that he gained broad recognition.',

        'Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (April 15, 1452 - May 2, 1519), more commonly Leonardo da Vinci or simply Leonardo, was an Italian Renaissance polymath whose areas of interest included invention, painting, sculpting, architecture, science, music, mathematics, engineering, literature, anatomy, geology, astronomy, botany, writing, history, and cartography.  He has been variously called the father of palaeontology, ichnology, and architecture, and is widely considered one of the greatest painters of all time.

He is now often called 'the father of modern advertising' because of his innovation in poster design.  The early advertising poster was characterized by a painterly quality as evidenced by early poster artists Jules Cheret, Alfred Choubrac and Hugo D'Alesi.  Cappiello, like other young artists, worked in way that was almost the opposite of his predecessors.  He was the first poster artist to use bold figures popping out of black backgrounds, a startling contrast to the posters early norm.",

Following the First World War, he founded the Ateliers d'Art Sacre (Workshops of Sacred Art), decorated the interiors of churches, and worked for a revival of religious art.",

        'Nicolas Poussin (June 1594 - November 19, 1665) was the leading painter of the classical French Baroque style, although he spent most of his working life in Rome.  Most of his works were on religious and mythological subjects painted for a small group of Italian and French collectors.  He returned to Paris for a brief period to serve as First Painter to the King under Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu, but soon returned to Rome and resumed his more traditional themes.  In his later years he gave growing prominence to the landscapes in his pictures.  His work is characterized by clarity, logic, and order, and favors line over color.  Until the 20th century he remained a major inspiration for such classically-oriented artists as Jacques-Louis David, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and Paul Cezanne.',

        "Paul Cezanne (January 19, 1839 - October 22, 1906) was a French artist and Post-Impressionist painter whose work laid the foundations of the transition from the 19th-century conception of artistic endeavor to a new and radically different world of art in the 20th century.

        "Eugene Henri Paul Gauguin (June 7, 1848 - May 8, 1903) was a French post-Impressionist artist.  Underappreciated until after his death, Gauguin is now recognized for his experimental use of color and Synthetist style that were distinctly different from Impressionism.  Towards the end of his life he spent ten years in French Polynesia, and most of his paintings from this time depict people or landscapes from that region.  His work was influential to the French avant-garde and many modern artists, such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse.  Gauguin's art became popular after his death, partially from the efforts of art dealer Ambroise Vollard, who organized exhibitions of his work late in his career and assisted in organizing two important posthumous exhibitions in Paris.",

        "Paul Klee (December 18, 1879 - June 29, 1940) was a German artist.  His highly individual style was influenced by movements in art that included Expressionism, Cubism, and Surrealism.  Klee was a natural draftsman who experimented with and eventually deeply explored color theory, writing about it extensively; his lectures Writings on Form and Design Theory (Schriften zur Form und Gestaltungslehre), published in English as the Paul Klee Notebooks, are held to be as important for modern art as Leonardo da Vinci's A Treatise on Painting for the Renaissance. He and his colleague, Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky, both taught at the Bauhaus school of art, design and architecture.  His works reflect his dry humor and his sometimes childlike perspective, his personal moods and beliefs, and his musicality.",

He was active in his native city Amsterdam but also worked for a long period in Antwerp, then the centre of artistic life in the Netherlands.  His genre scenes were influential on later Flemish Baroque painting, Dutch still life painting and also in Italy.

He is credited with the invention of the monumental genre scene, which combines still life and genre painting and often also includes a biblical scene in the background.  He was active in his native city Amsterdam but also worked for a long period in Antwerp, then the centre of artistic life in the Netherlands.  His genre scenes were influential on later Flemish Baroque painting, Dutch still life painting and also in Italy.  His peasant scenes preceded by a few years the much better-known paintings produced in Antwerp by Pieter Bruegel the Elder.',

        'Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino (March 28, 1483 - April 6, 1520), known as Raphael, was an Italian painter and architect of the High Renaissance.  His work is admired for its clarity of form, ease of composition, and visual achievement of the Neoplatonic ideal of human grandeur.  Together with Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, he forms the traditional trinity of great masters of that period.  Raphael was enormously productive, running an unusually large workshop and, despite his death at 37, leaving a large body of work.  Many of his works are found in the Vatican Palace, where the frescoed Raphael Rooms were the central, and the largest, work of his career.  The best known work is The School of Athens in the Vatican Stanza della Segnatura.',

        'Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino (March 28, 1483 - April 6, 1520), known as Raphael, was an Italian painter and architect of the High Renaissance.  His work is admired for its clarity of form, ease of composition, and visual achievement of the Neoplatonic ideal of human grandeur.  Together with Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, he forms the traditional trinity of great masters of that period.  Raphael was enormously productive, running an unusually large workshop and, despite his death at 37, leaving a large body of work.  Many of his works are found in the Vatican Palace, where the frescoed Raphael Rooms were the central, and the largest, work of his career.

        "Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn (July 15, 1606 - October 4, 1669) was a Dutch draughtsman, painter, and printmaker.  An innovative and prolific master in three media, he is generally considered one of the greatest visual artists in the history of art and the most important in Dutch art history.  Unlike most Dutch masters of the 17th century, Rembrandt's works depict a wide range of style and subject matter, from portraits and self-portraits to landscapes, genre scenes, allegorical and historical scenes, biblical and mythological themes as well as animal studies.  His contributions to art came in a period of great wealth and cultural achievement that historians call the Dutch Golden Age, when Dutch art (especially Dutch painting), although in many ways antithetical to the Baroque style that dominated Europe, was extremely prolific and innovative, and gave rise to important new genres.

An innovative and prolific master in three media, he is generally considered one of the greatest visual artists in the history of art and the most important in Dutch art history.  Unlike most Dutch masters of the 17th century, Rembrandt's works depict a wide range of style and subject matter, from portraits and self-portraits to landscapes, genre scenes, allegorical and historical scenes, biblical and mythological themes as well as animal studies.  His contributions to art came in a period of great wealth and cultural achievement that historians call the Dutch Golden Age, when Dutch art (especially Dutch painting), although in many ways antithetical to the Baroque style that dominated Europe, was extremely prolific and innovative, and gave rise to important new genres.  Like many artists of the Dutch Golden Age, such as Jan Vermeer of Delft, Rembrandt was also known as an avid art collector and dealer.",

        "Wassily Wassilyevich Kandinsky (December 16, 1866 - December 13, 1944) was a Russian painter and art theorist.  He is credited with painting one of the first recognised purely abstract works.  Born in Moscow, Kandinsky spent his childhood in Odessa, where he graduated at Grekov Odessa Art school.  He enrolled at the University of Moscow, studying law and economics.  Kandinsky began painting studies (life-drawing, sketching and anatomy) at the age of 30.  In 1896, Kandinsky settled in Munich, studying first at Anton Azbe's private school and then at the Academy of Fine Arts.  He returned to Moscow in 1914, after the outbreak of World War I.  Kandinsky was unsympathetic to the official theories on art in Communist Moscow, and returned to Germany in 1920.  There, he taught at the Bauhaus school of art and architecture from 1922 until the Nazis closed it in 1933.  He then moved to France, where he lived for the rest of his life, becoming a French citizen in 1939 and producing some of his most prominent art.  He died at Neuilly-sur-Seine in 1944.",

        "Wassily Wassilyevich Kandinsky (December 16, 1866 - December 13, 1944) was a Russian painter and art theorist.  He is credited with painting one of the first recognised purely abstract works.  Born in Moscow, Kandinsky spent his childhood in Odessa, where he graduated at Grekov Odessa Art school.  He enrolled at the University of Moscow, studying law and economics.  Kandinsky began painting studies (life-drawing, sketching and anatomy) at the age of 30.  In 1896, Kandinsky settled in Munich, studying first at Anton Azbe's private school and then at the Academy of Fine Arts.  He returned to Moscow in 1914, after the outbreak of World War I.  Kandinsky was unsympathetic to the official theories on art in Communist Moscow, and returned to Germany in 1920.  There, he taught at the Bauhaus school of art and architecture from 1922 until the Nazis closed it in 1933.  He then moved to France, where he lived for the rest of his life, becoming a French citizen in 1939 and producing some of his most prominent art.  He died at Neuilly-sur-Seine in 1944.",

        'William-Adolphe Bouguereau (November 30, 1825 - August 19, 1905) was a French academic painter.  In his realistic genre paintings he used mythological themes, making modern interpretations of classical subjects, with an emphasis on the female human body.  During his life he enjoyed significant popularity in France and the United States, was given numerous official honors, and received top prices for his work.  As the quintessential salon painter of his generation, he was reviled by the Impressionist avant-garde.  By the early twentieth century, Bouguereau and his art fell out of favor with the public, due in part to changing tastes.  In the 1980s, a revival of interest in figure painting led to a rediscovery of Bouguereau and his work.  Throughout the course of his life, Bouguereau executed 822 known finished paintings, although the whereabouts of many are still unknown.',

        'William-Adolphe Bouguereau (November 30, 1825 - August 19, 1905) was a French academic painter.  In his realistic genre paintings he used mythological themes, making modern interpretations of classical subjects, with an emphasis on the female human body.  During his life he enjoyed significant popularity in France and the United States, was given numerous official honors, and received top prices for his work.  As the quintessential salon painter of his generation, he was reviled by the Impressionist avant-garde.  By the early twentieth century, Bouguereau and his art fell out of favor with the public, due in part to changing tastes.  In the 1980s, a revival of interest in figure painting led to a rediscovery of Bouguereau and his work.  Throughout the course of his life, Bouguereau executed 822 known finished paintings, although the whereabouts of many are still unknown.',
